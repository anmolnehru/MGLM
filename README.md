NEWS!!!

c++ code for DTI based on Armadillo takes 1 min 43 sec per voxel!
40-50 times faster than unoptimzed matlab code.
10 times faster than optized matlab code.


1) ODF regression with smoothed ODFs will be started today

2) You will read the Guy Lebanon's thesis in detail

3) After you migrate the existing code to github I will start getting the basic input/output features coded in C++ in that github project
